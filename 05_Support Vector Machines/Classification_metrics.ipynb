    "|------------|--------------|----------|-----|\n",
    "|Accuracy\t|The proportion of correctly classified instances among the total instances.\t|General performance evaluation when the class distribution is balanced.|$$\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}  $$|\n",
    "|Precision\t|The proportion of true positive predictions among the total positive predictions.\t|Important when the cost of false positives is high.|$$\\text{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} $$|\n",
    "|Recall (Sensitivity)\t|The proportion of true positive predictions among the actual positive instances.\t|Crucial when the cost of false negatives is high.|$$\\text{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$|\n",
    "|F1-Score\t|The harmonic mean of precision and recall.|\tUseful for imbalanced class distributions as it balances precision and recall.|$$ \\text{F1-Score} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\cdot \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}$$|\n",
    "|ROC-AUC Score\t|The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate.\t|Evaluates the classifier's ability to distinguish between positive and negative instances.||\n",
    "|Confusion Matrix\t|A matrix that summarizes the performance by showing the true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN).\t|Provides a comprehensive view of the model's performance and error distribution.||\n",
    "|Cohen's Kappa\t|Measures the agreement between predicted and true labels, adjusted for chance.|Useful to compare model performance when the class distribution is imbalanced.|$$\\kappa = \\frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e} $$ where: $$p_o$$ is the observed agreement (proportion of instances where the raters/classifiers agree)  $$p_e$$ is the expected agreement by chance|\n",
    "|Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)\t|A measure of the quality of binary classifications, taking into account TP, TN, FP, and FN.\t|Effective for evaluating performance with imbalanced datasets.|$$\\text{MCC} = \\frac{TP \\cdot TN - FP \\cdot FN}{\\sqrt{(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)}} $$|\n",
    "|Hinge Loss|Hinge loss is specifically designed for binary classification tasks where the goal is to separate two classes with a large margin.|If your goal is to create a classifier that not only separates the classes but also maximizes the margin between them, hinge loss is an ideal choice. This property is particularly useful for achieving better generalization performance.|The hinge loss for a given training set $$ (x_i, y_i) $$ where $$(x_i)$$ is the feature vector and $$(y_i \\in \\{-1, +1\\})$$ is the class label is defined as follows:$$ L(y, f(x)) = \\max(0, 1 - y \\cdot f(x)) $$|"
